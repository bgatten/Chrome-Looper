Video Playback Controller Extension
The Video Playback Controller Extension is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your video watching experience on the web. It allows users to specify start and end times for looping video playback, ideal for studying, analyzing specific scenes, or continuously enjoying your favorite parts of videos. However, it's important to note that pre-roll ads can affect the specified timing.

Features
Loop Control: Set precise start and end points for video looping, perfect for repetitive viewing of specific segments.
Ad Detection: The extension attempts to detect and skip ads, but pre-roll ads can still impact the accuracy of the start and end times set for the loop.
How It Works
Setting Loop Points: Through the extension's popup, users can input the desired start and end times for the video loop.
Playback Control: Once the loop points are set and the "Loop" button is clicked, the extension controls the video playback to loop between the specified times.
Installation
Download the extension package.
Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's directory.
Usage
Play any video in your Chrome browser.
Click on the extension icon and set the desired start and end times for your loop.
Press the "Loop" button to activate the looping functionality.
The video will now loop between the set start and end points.
Important Note on Ads
If an ad plays before the start of the video, it can disrupt the set start time. The extension tries to detect and handle ads, but timing might be affected if an ad plays initially or during the video playback.
